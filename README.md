# SmartCities-Project-1
UAV Tracking for Smart Cities

## Motivation

Pedestrian identification has become increasingly important, particularly to enable smart cities. While mounted cameras exist in many cities, use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), such as drones, is becoming increasingly common. The first step to enabling use of video footage, from these types of elevated platforms, is to perform pedestrian detection. This step will then enable other tasks such as pedestrian tracking. For example, imagine a situation in which a pedestrian being hit by a car could be detected, so that emergency services could be automatically dispatched to the scene.

## Overview

This project will address two related challenges: (i) pedestrian detection; and (ii) pedestrian re-identification. Specifically, once a unique pedestrian has been detected in a video, is it possible to re-identify them (as the same individual) should they be occluded momentarily from the camera view?

## Objectives

There are two main objectives of the project. First, detection of unique individuals must be performed, relative to other pedestrians in the scene. Second, re-identification of an individual must be performed, in the presence of occlusions. If an individual is detected once, then lost temporarily, the methods must successfully identify them again as the same individual.
